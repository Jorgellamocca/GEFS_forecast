The Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) is a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) weather forecast model. GEFS creates 31 separate forecasts (ensemble members) to describe the range of forecast uncertainty.

This dataset is an archive of past and present GEFS forecasts. Forecasts are identified by an initialization time (init_time) denoting the start time of the model run as well as by the ensemble_member. Each forecast has a 3 hourly forecast step along the lead_time dimension. This dataset contains only the 00 hour UTC initialization times which produce the full length, 35 day forecast.

Storage for this dataset is generously provided by Source Cooperative, a Radiant Earth initiative.
